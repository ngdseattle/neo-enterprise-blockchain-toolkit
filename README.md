# Neo Enterprise Blockchain Toolkit 

End-to-end, integrated set of developer tools for teams of any size with enterprise-level quality and scale requirements.

A comprehensive toolkit and capabilities spanning a best-in-class integrated development environment, advanced debugging and diagnostics, validation and compliance, and industry-leading standards support, to model, design, develop, test, and deploy enterprise-class blockchain solutions.

## Key Capabilities

### Neo Visual Token Designer

- Best-in-class modeling and design experience to define, validate, test, and deploy digital assets


### Neo Smart Contract Debugger

- Fully integrated Smart Contract debugging experience inside of Visual Studio Code
- Enhanced Time-Travel debugging support

### Neo Express

- Real-world PrivateNet - enabling complete end-to-end scenarios for Neo 2.x and
  Neo 3.0, built on top of the Neo MainNet codebase
- Manage Neo Express for multiple nodes and multiple developers from within Visual
  Studio Code or using command-line utilities
- Enhanced operations for developer scenarios. e.g. Snapshot/Rollback/FastForward/Replay etc.

### Neo Visual DevTracker

- Explore public and private Neo blockchains from within Visual Studio Code
- Transfer assets, claim GAS, deploy and invoke smart contracts on public and
  private Neo blockchains from withing Visual Studio Code
- Create and manage Neo Express instances from within Visual Studio Code

### NEON Smart Contract Compiler

- Enhanced Compiler with metadata to map .NET source code to NeoVM byte code and
  function variables/arguments information etc.
- Create, Edit, Compile, Debug, Test, and Deploy Smart Contracts on both Neo 2.x
  and Neo 3.0 from within Visual Studio Code

### Smart Contract Templates in .NET languages

- Friction-free templates and guidance for developer productivity
- Real-World production quality Smart Contract Development in minutes

### Neo-FX Library

- Unified Programming Model for a consistent and highly productive developer
  experience spanning remote, node and contract SDKs.
- Neo-FX will provide a common set of fundamental types (such as large unsigned
  integers for hash values and elliptic curves for cryptography), domain models
  (such as blocks and transactions) and service abstractions (such as retrieving
  a transaction or invoking a smart contract).
- By using these common set of types across SDKs, developers will be able to move
  their code between SDKs, ensuring they can run their code in the manner that
  makes most sense for their blockchain application.
